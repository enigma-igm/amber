AMBER: A Semi-numerical Abundance Matching Box for the Epoch of Reionization [(Trac et al. 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10375)

This semi-numerical code takes the novel approach of calculating the reionization-redshift field assuming that hydrogen gas encountering higher radiation intensity are photoionized earlier. Redshift values are assigned while matching the abundance of ionized mass according to a given mass-weighted ionization fraction. The code has the unique advantage of allowing users to directly specify the reionization history through the redshift midpoint, duration, and asymmetry input parameters. The reionization process is further controlled through the minimum halo mass for galaxy formation and the radiation mean free path for radiative transfer.
